This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## What is this ?

A React app developed using the Ghibli API to display basic information about Studio Ghibli characters, films, locations, species and their relations. 
Everything is click based, so you can use it as a visual guide to help remember all the magical univers of Ghibli movies. 
I had fun building this app, it helped me practice and learn how `ReactJS` works.

## Where does the information come from?

You can learn more in the [Create React App documentation](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/getting-started).

To learn React, check out the [React documentation](https://reactjs.org/).

This app utilizes the [Ghibli API](https://ghibliapi.herokuapp.com/), so the unkown information displayed as "No data" in this app will be updated as the API is updated. As for the pictures, they were freely collected from Ghibli Wiki. Studio Ghibli and all associated names and/or images are copyright Studio Ghibli.

### Notice a bug or have improvment ideas?

Please, if you notice something weird with the website, let me know by sending an email at hell.justine@gmail.com. 
The same goes for site improvements and/or ideas. This app was greatly inspired by the "Star Wars - A visual Guide" website created by TIM SARVEY. 
You can visit his amazing work [here](https://starwars-visualguide.com/#/).

`Thanks !`
